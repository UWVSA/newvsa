					<p> Hey there!  My name is Jimmy.  I'm a Canadian-born first generation Vietnamese who grew up in Toronto, Ontario in the west end of North York; a region of which has and still is developing.  (In the Jane and Finch area if you guys have heard of it, so I'm pretty much from the ghetto.)  Consequently, throughout much of my life, I've had little opportunities to volunteer and support my community.  Coming to Waterloo, there are so many opportunities available to become involved, and along this journey, I decided to join UWVSA in order to not only provide fun events and educate others on Vietnamese culture, but to also develop myself along the way!</p>
