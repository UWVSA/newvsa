					<p> I grew up in a very non-Asian town, Alliston. My parents were heavy with Asian culture, they made sure I knew where 
					I was coming from and that I would know about my culture. I got interested in VSA through my Vietnamese 
					friends during orientation who had joined VSA that very same term. I was surprised when there was a 
					VSA and hoped to join in my first Winter Term, but due to the hectic schedule of that year&#8217;s exec team 
					they were unable to run that Winter Term. My hobbies comprise of reading novels, sports, video games and dancing. 
					I am an active member in the Waterloo Community being the Vice-President of the University of Waterloo Breakers 
					and a member of University of Waterloo Hip-hop community. </p>
