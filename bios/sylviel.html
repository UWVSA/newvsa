					<p> Bonjour a tous! Je m'appelle Sylvie! That's right,
					I can speak Frenglemese (a.k.a French, English, and 
					Vietnamese). I was raised in an all European school 
					system in Montreal. I was never able to meet more than
					four Vietnamese people for 15 years of my life. After
					moving to Ontario and attending University, never in my
					life have I seen this many Orientals gathered in one 
					area like uWaterloo. Seeing this chance to learn more 
					about my own culture and people, I reached out to VSA 
					where I met and made mesmerizing memories and 
					friendships. VSA showed me so much love, that I had 
					to be part of the exec team in hopes that I can pass 
					down the same experience to future VSA members. </p>
