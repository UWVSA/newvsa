					<p>Hey! I grew up being influenced by Vietnamese culture. However, as years passed by, 
					I slowly grew apart from my roots. When I started at the University of Waterloo, I stumbled upon VSA, 
					and instantly connected with other Vietnamese students. This gave me an opportunity to proudly identify 
					myself as a Vietnamese - Canadian. As an ignite coordinator I am very excited to showcase the beauty of 
					Vietnamese culture through this event! <br>
					I am a certified shopaholic, love playing volleyball, and 
					usually can be heard singing in the shower (much to my housemate's dismay). You can find me at 
					PAC playing intramural volleyball, or nerding it out in goggles and a labcoat. </p>
