					<p> Hey everyone, you&#8217;re probably wondering 
					what VP Operation even means. I basically oversee all the 
					planning and execution VSA&#8217;s events. I was born and raised 
					in Mississauga and according to the other executives, have a 
					heavy north viet accent. I joined VSA to reconnect to my Vietnamese 
					roots and got to meet awesome people. On my free time I like to swim, 
					bike or make music. My favourite foods include avocado, sushi and 
					spinach! I&#8217;m always excited to try something new and challenge myself. 
					I&#8217;m always trying new part-time jobs every co-op term, some places 
					I&#8217;ve worked at so far are Mexx, Eddie Bauer, Lifetime Fitness, 
					Spring Rolls, Express and hopefully much much more! </p>
