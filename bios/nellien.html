					<p> Hello lovelies! My name is Nellie (yes like the <q>it&#8217;s getting hot in here</q> rapper). 
					I&#8217;m your typical small town girl who aside from my family was never really 
					exposed to Vietnamese culture. As I entered my first year at the 
					University of Waterloo, joining UWVSA was a must! No questions asked. 
					UWVSA became my support and home. Being an active member and executive 
					first year led me to become VSA&#8217;s President second year 
					(yes, call me crazy, so young)! Aside from UWVSA, I enjoy meeting 
					new people, making fried bananas, and I&#8217;m attempting to teach myself 
					how to play the ukulele! I aim to change the world one smile at a time. </p>
