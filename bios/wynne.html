					<p> Hi everyone! I am half Chinese and half Vietnamese.
					I grew up in a household where we were more Chinese 
					culture orientated. Yeup, I went to Chinese classes and
					spoke Cantonese at home. I was never really taught 
					anything about my Vietnamese culture nor the language. 
					After checking out the clubs that the University of 
					Waterloo had to offer, I found out about VSA and joined 
					to learn what my parents never really taught me. This 
					was also a chance for me to discover new things and of 
					course meet new people in my first year of university.
					I hope to be on the team throughout my next 5 years 
					here and help this group grow!
					</p>
