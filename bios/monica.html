					<p> Throughout high school, I didn't have many Viet friends 
					(maybe because I am half-Viet and half-Chinese?), but since I was starting a 
					new chapter for university away from home, I figured I'd change 
					all that! So I joined VSA to get more in touch with my roots and 
					to meet new people. As well being an exec member, I am  
					also a part of Kappa Kappa Gamma, one of three sororities here
					on campus. I love playing volleyball, baking sweets, cooking food, and enjoy
					catching up on TV shows such as Revenge, Suits, TVD, Hawaii Five-O on my spare time.  </p>
