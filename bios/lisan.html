					<p> I grew up loving the Vietnamese culture and music (yes, VPOP). I found that it was hard to 
					find someone to share these similar interests with. I am currently a Laurier
					student yet, people mistake me for being a uWaterloo student ALL the time. 
					You will often find me around campus as I love being involved with the VSA 
					club, so much, that I keep coming back for more. I joined VSA to meet new 
					people, as Laurier does not have a VSA club. I am actively
					involved with the AIESEC organization at Laurier and love to colour my hair
					often (might just be bald one day, just saying). </p>
