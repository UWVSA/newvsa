					<p>  I am an international student from Vietnam. 
					I am extremely excited to be taking on the role of Cultural Executive for the 2014-2015 year. 
					Being a part of the UW VSA provides me with the opportunity to spread 
					the awareness of the wonderful Vietnamese culture. One of my favorite
					things about UW VSA (although it&#8217;s hard to narrow it down) is its focus 
					on diversity and inclusion of all its members.
					Since 2012, I have worked as an Undergrad Teaching 
					Assistant for the Math Faculty and am actively involved 
					with the Student Alumni Association at Laurier.  I
					hopes to see you around campus and if you have any 
					questions about UW VSA, don&#8217;t hesitate to ask me!</p>
