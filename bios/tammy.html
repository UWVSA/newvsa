					<p> Hi, My name&#8217;s Tammy! I&#8217;m originally from Barrie, and growing up, 
					I was very immersed in Vietnamese culture. When I moved to Waterloo 
					for school, I joined VSA because I wanted to stay connected with my 
					roots and to meet other students who also shared a similar appreciation 
					for Vietnamese culture. This year I am proud to be a part of the 
					Executive Team for VSA, and I&#8217;m looking forward to the exciting events
					that we have planned to come. When I don&#8217;t have my head buried in a book 
					(typical English major!) I enjoy baking, DIY crafts (I spend way too much 
					time on Pinterest) and in the winter, I love to hit up the slopes and go
					skiing. Please feel free to stay hi or send me a message if you share any interests, I&#8217;m always happy to make new friends!  </p>
