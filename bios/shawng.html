					<p> Hello everyone! I'm a first year student eager to meet new people, experience new things, and learn new skills. 
					I'm always up for an adventure, which is why I decided to join VSA even though I'm not even Viet! (But shhh don't tell anyone). 
					Just kidding, the club here is really welcoming to people of any ethnicity 
					and I'm looking forward to playing my role in helping the club grow. I love to play soccer, 
					and am also passionate about technology. If these are some areas that you are interested in, or 
					just would like to know more about, please feel free to contact me.

					</p>
